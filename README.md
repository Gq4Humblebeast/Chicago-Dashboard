# Chicago Population Dashboard (2018 - 2022)
### Interactive visualization dashboard in Python 

In this project I analyzed the population of my hometown Chicago with data from 2018 to 2021. I specifically focused on the Zip Codes (60609, 60649, 60624) that I lived in growing up which mostly revolves around the southside of Chicago. Additionally I also focused on the Male and Female population within those areas. Lastly, I focused on my generation, GenZ in comparison with GenX and Millennials. With this focus I was able to create Interactive visualizations to make up my dashboard to see how the population has changed overtime in Chicago through the years.
