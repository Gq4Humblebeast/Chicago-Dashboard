# Chicago Population Dashboard (2018 - 2022)
### Interactive visualization dashboard in Python 

In this project, I analyzed the population of my hometown, Chicago, using data from 2018 to 2021. I specifically focused on the ZIP codes 60609, 60649, and 60624, which are centered around the South Side of Chicago, where I grew up. Additionally, I examined the male and female populations within these areas. I also compared my generation, Gen Z, with Gen X and Millennials. This analysis allowed me to create interactive visualizations for my dashboard, illustrating how the population in Chicago has changed over time.

For more information on how I used python to create my dashboard check out my attched file Chicago(2).ipynb
